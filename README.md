## 1. Problem Statement
Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), is a technology that enables the conversion of spoken language into written text. It is a complex task that involves understanding and processing human speech, which varies widely in terms of accents, pronunciations, speed, and context. Deep learning has revolutionized speech recognition by providing powerful models that can learn from vast amounts of audio data, improving the accuracy and robustness of ASR systems. 

The primary objective of speech recognition is to develop a model that can accurately transcribe spoken words into written text. This involves several key challenges:

- **Acoustic Variability:**  Handling different accents, intonations, and speaking speeds.
- **Background Noise:** Distinguishing speech from various background noises.
- **Context Understanding:** Recognizing and interpreting words within the context of a sentence.
- **Vocabulary Size:** Managing a large vocabulary and differentiating between similar-sounding words.

### Applications

- **Voice Assistants:** Powering virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.
- **Transcription Services:** Automating the transcription of meetings, interviews, and lectures.
- **Accessibility:** Assisting individuals with hearing impairments by providing real-time text transcriptions.
- **Call Centers:** Automating customer service interactions and analyzing call center data.
